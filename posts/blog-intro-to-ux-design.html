                        Despite the infitie ways you can "style"
                        a website. There are instrinsic limitations
                        that you need to be aware of.
                        One of you compare a website to

                        One of the limiting factors of websites is
                        that there is little space to work with.
                        That means there is little space to display/explain/demonstrait whatever your
                        product or service your website provide.
                        This is specially true for mobile screens.

                        Another factor is that you cannot engage with content
                        with all your senses.
                        you cannot smell things you cannot feel things, you cannot taste things. You cannot feel things.
                        <img class="" src="../media/blog-intro-to-ux-design/mobile-600x-01.webp" alt="mobile image">
                        even special experience is limited in a 2d space (although VR might change that soon).
                        nonetheless, you have 2 senses to work with to form the user experience. Visual and Auditory.

                        Jesse James Garet author of the book the elements of style has applied website design to a
                        spectrum.
                        It is between a Library and a Gallery. In one extreme you have pure functionality and no
                        stimulation.
                        and in the other extreme is pure graphical website with little usability.

                        I think this also applies to working with the users senses. Too much stimulation without
                        inviting the other senses makes
                        the experience incomplete. Also too much stimulation makes the experience annoying.


                        We have to work with a small window in a way to present as much information as possible that can
                        fit
                        into that window without comprimising usability or style. Striking the middle ground can be
                        easy. But you also need
                        to keep people coming back. Good functionality will keep users coming but coupled with balnd
                        style might
                        make users less likely to come back as much.

                        So with the infinite ways to design a website. You will only work with
                        2 senses or none in the case of blind or deaf users.

                        With that settled now we need to know how to work with these two senses to provide a great user
                        experience.

                        Most blogs and in fact any website is comprised of text. Not only is text used for content value
                        but also to rank up in search engines as web crawlers use text and not images to understand the
                        content of a web page.
