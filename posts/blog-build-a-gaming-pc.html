					<h3>Optional:</h3>

					<a href="#case"><img src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/case-100x-02.webp" width="100"></a>


				</div>
				<div>


					<p class="note">
						I will be using the game <b>Assasin Creed Valhalla</b>
						system requirments as a reference. I have not played the game
						. it was picked randomly</p>




					<p> According to gamespot to be able to play
						<b>Assasin Creed Valhalla</b>
						at 1080p, 30 FPS you would need:
						<ul>
							<li>CPU: 3.2 - 3.6GHz</li>
							<li>RAM: 8GB</li>
							<li>GPU: RX 570 - 8GB/GTX 1060 - 6GB</li>
							<li>Storage: 50GB</li>
						</ul>
						<p>With that in mind lets check each part</p>

						<div id="mb"></div>
						<br>

						<h2>Motherboard</h2>



						<p>
							The motherboard combines the rest of the parts
							and facilitate the communication
							between all the parts.
							For that reason it is important to choose a good motherboard
						</p>

						<h3>Things to look for in a motherboard:</h3>
						<ul>

							<li>What CPU chipset does it support?</li>
							<p>
								motherboard models are manufactored to serve certain CPU chipsets.
								It is important to decide on the CPU before purchasing a motherboard.

								<div class="note">
									<p> if you go with an old motherboard model
										you would need to update the BIOS and to do
										 that you need a CPU that is compatable
										 with the current BIOS in order to access it
										</p>
								</div>

								<li>What type and version of PCI-e does it have
									<p> Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI-e)
										are the slots where you plug
										your expansion cards.
										expansion cards come with a set of pins that goes into these slots.
										x1, x4, x8 and x16. GPUs typically come in x16.
										In some motherboards they can be plugged into x8
										but using only the x8 throughput.
										<p class="note">
										A test made by <a
											href="www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2488-pci-e-x8-vs-x16-performance-impace-on-gpus">
											gamersnexus</a>
										showed that there is no real difference in
										performance between x8 and x16</p>
										If it came to this pick the one that is cheaper but make sure that
										the x8 solt is open ended to accomedate the x16.
										start from version 2.0 @ x16 and up.

										you want to aim at
										at a minimum
										you would need
										1 GPU slot and 1 RAM slot.</p>
								</li>

								<li>What size is it.
									<p> bigger forms have more feauters
										and expansion slot. Smaller ones are more expensive</p>
									<p>Below are the 3 common sizes.</p>
								</li>
						</ul>

						<img src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/form-factor-300w-01.png" width="300">

						<div id="cpu"></div>
						<br>
						<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
						<!--	<img class="thumb200" src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/cpu200-01.png">-->
						<p>Your first part to pick should be the CPU because other parts depend on the chipset you
							choose
						</p>
						<p>
							CPU purpose is to process software instructions.
							It is important to have a fast processor
							because slow processor contribute to the game lag.


						</p>

						<h3>Things to look for in a CPU:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>CPU clock speed (in GHz)
								A 3.2GHz process
								3.2 billion instructions per second.

							</li>


							<li>Number of Cores it has.
								<p> Modern CPU chips come in multiple "cores".
									Each core acts as a an independent CPU.
									<div class="note">
										more cores does not mean faster CPU.
										A 4 cores CPU is not 4x faster than 1 core CPU.
										It does however affect program performance</p>
				</div>
				Based on my research it seems that 4 cores is a good number for most games.



				<div id="ram"></div>
				<br>
				<h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
	

					<h3>Things to look for in a RAM</h3>

					<ul>
						<li> Capacity (in GB)</li>


						<li> speed (in Mhz)</li>
						Speed determine the time it takes the RAM to retrieve
						Data from its table.
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p class="note"> Speed or size?
						More RAM. RAMs are fairly fast in storing and retrieving data.

						A 6 to 8GB DDR4 RAM with 2133-2400Mhz (2.133Ghz-2.4Ghz) should good for most games.
					</p>
					<p id="gpu"></p>
					<br>
					<h2>Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
					<p> GPU like CPU but it process graphical instructions.
						These instructions are passed to the GPU for processing.

						What you should be looking for in a GPU:

					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>GPU clock speed (MHz)</li>
						<li>Memory bus (bits)</li>
						<li>vRAM size (MB)</li>
						<li>Memory clock rate (MHz)</li>
						<li>Memory bandwidth (GB/s)</li>
					</ul>

					<div id="storage"></div>
					<br>
					<h2>Long Term Persistent Storage</h2>
					<p>These unlike RAM will not lose the data when the PC is turned off.
						There is two types:
						HDD Hard Disk Drive
						SSD Solid State Drive
						The HDD is an old model. It is slower but cheaper than SSD specially when buying a significant
						amount of storage space.
						SSD is is the new storage model
						it has a faster boot time and faster file transfers than HDD but it is expensive as well.

						Every year technology gets cheaper so the comparison only holds when you
						want to buy a huge amount of storage (say in the terabyte range).

						Below are different forms of SSD
						<img src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/storage-type-300w-01.webp" width="300">
					</p>

					<h4>Things to look for in storage device:</h4>



					<ul>
						<li>size (GB)</li>
						<li>speed (GHz)</li>
					</ul>




					<div id="fan"></div>
					<br>
					<h2>Cooling sources</h2>
					<p>You need some cooling device for your system to avoid
						overheating, like a car radiator.
						<a href="">read more here</a> but for our purposes
						a refular fan will suffice
					</p>
					<p>Things you should be looking for</p>
					<ul>
						<li>pins in the fans</li>
						<p>some fans connect and controlled automatically
							by the motherboard and some can be controlled by the user.
							Depending on the section you plug it in
						</p>
					</ul>





					<div id="psu"></div>
					<br>
					<h2>Power Supply</h2>

					PSUs come in 3 forms
					<img src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/psu-300w-01-linustechtips.webp" width="300">

					<p><b>Non-Modular:</b> Comes with all the cables soldered</p>

					<p><b>Semi-Modular:</b> will have the basic cables soldered to
						the unit, like the motherboard connector, the CPU cable,
						and the PCIe power connector</p>

					<p><b>Modular:</b>Comes without any cables soldered to the unit.</p>


					Modular is the most expensive. The non-modular is the most practical, the other two are more for
					aesthtic
					features.


					<p>
						PSU comes with an 80+ rating which means that
						the unit is at least 80% effecient at different workloads
						(20%,50% and 100%). so at 100% workload
						a PSU will supply at least 80%.

						some PSU also come with different labels like

						bronze,silver,gold,platinum, or titanium.

						for example
						an 80+ bronze unit would have 82% effecincy at 20% and 100% workload.
						but 85% at 50% workload.
						titanium works out at at 90%,92%, and 94%.

						<p class="note">PSUs are
							most effecient at 50% workload.
							If you want to take advantage of the labeled (and more expensive)
							PSU, aim for 50% workload otherwise a regular 80+ PSU is fine.</p>




						In either case you want to aim for at
						least 20% more power than what your system needs.
					</p>
					<p>
						when you figure out the amout of power
						your system needs, plug the numbers in the formulars below.
					</p>
					<p>
						<kbd> labeledPSUpower = total-sys-power/.5
							regularPSUpower = total-sys-power/.8
						</kbd>
					</p>



					<div id="display"></div>
					<br>
					<h2>Display Monitor</h2>
					<p>
						Why bother with a gaming setup if you
						cannot enjoy the result? :)
						The Display plays an important part in
						the pc build process deserve its own article
						<a href="">read more here</a> but for our
						purposes ill keep it brief.

					</p>
					<h4>Things to look for in a Display Monitor</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>How wide is it and what resuotion
							does it support
							<p>
								width is the physical dimension of the Display
								my research showed me that a standard gaming
								display is 27-30 inches. with support for
								1080p and more.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>How many Frames per second does it support

							<p>This can range from 64 to 128 FBS
								more frames = smoother picture.
								you do not need more than 32FPS
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>



					<p id="kb"></p>
					<br>
					<h2>Keyboard and Mouse</h2>
					<p>
						If you want to game you want a keyboard that is big enough
						for fast tapping. For the Mouse you really can go with any.
						you can go for more aethetic Mouse but for the most part it will be the same
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The size of the key board</li>
					</ul>




					<p id="case"></p>
					<br>
					<h2>Chassis</h2>
					<p>Chassis are optional, Its just a way to neatly
						orgnize everything. you can hang them from the wall
						if you want to.

						If you decide to go with a chassis then have some
						points in mind
						Make sure there is a sufficent space for air to flow.

					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the size of the chassis</li>
						<p>you want a reasonable space between parts for air flow.
						</p>

					</ul>


					<p>Building a Computer can be a fun activity once you become familiar with its components. Its
						like
						building a car engine but with no gas or pollution.
						If you feel ready or want to experement with the different
						factors mentioned above
