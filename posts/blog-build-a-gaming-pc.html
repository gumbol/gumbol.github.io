					<p>
						After knowing the parts needed,
						the next step is to figure out the parts you need.

						<div class="note">
							I will be using <b>Assasin Creed Valhalla</b>
							system requirments as a reference. I have not played the game
							And i just picked at random</div>


					</p>

					<p> According to gamespot to be able to play
						<b>Assasin Creed Valhalla</b>
						at 1080p, 30 FPS you would need: <br>
						CPU: 3.2 - 3.6GHz
						RAM: 8GB
						GPU: RX 570 - 8GB/GTX 1060 - 6GB
						Storage: 50GB</p>
					<!--	<img style="float:left;" class="thumb200" src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/motherboard-160w-01.png" width:"75">-->
					<h2>Motherboard</h2>



					<p>
						This is the part
						that combines the rest of the parts
						and facilitate the communication
						between all the parts.
						For that reason it is important to choose a good motherboard
					</p>

					<h3>Things to look for in a motherboard:</h3>
					<ul>

						<li>What CPU chipset does it support?</li>
						<p>
							motherboard models are manufactored to serve certain CPU chipsets.
							It is important to decide on the CPU before purchasing a motherboard.
							
							<div class="note">
								<p> if you go with an old model you would need to
									update the BIOS and to access it you
									need to have an old
									CPU.</p>
							</div>



							<li>What type and version of PCI-e does it have
								<p> Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI-e)
									are the slots where you plug
									your expansion cards.
									expansion cards come with a set of pins that goes into these slots.
									x1, x4, x8 and x16. GPUs typically come in x16.
									In some motherboards they can be plugged into x8
									but using only the x8 throughput.
									A test made by <a
										href="www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2488-pci-e-x8-vs-x16-performance-impace-on-gpus">
										gamersnexus</a>
									showed that there is no real difference in
									performance between x8 and x16
									If it came to this pick the one that is cheaper.
									start from version 2.0 @ x16 and up.

									you want to aim at
									at a minimum
									you would need
									1 GPU slot and 1 RAM slot.</p>
							</li>

							<li>What size is it.
								<p> bigger forms have more expansion slots and therefore more options
									but smaller form factors are more compact and portable.</p>
								<p>Below are the 3 common sizes.</p>
							</li>
					</ul>


					<img src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/form-factor-300w-01.png" width="300">

					<p>Once you have picked the motherboard it is time to
						pick the main brain or the CPU</p>


					<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
					<!--	<img class="thumb200" src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/cpu200-01.png">-->
					<p>Your first part to pick should be the CPU because other parts depend on the chipset you choose
					</p>
					<p>
						CPU purpose is to process software instructions.
						It is important to have a fast processor
						because slow processor contribute to the game lag.


					</p>

					<h3>Things to look for in a CPU:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>CPU clock speed (in GHz)
							A 3.2GHz process
							3.2 billion instructions per second.

						</li>


						<li>Number of Cores it has.
							<p> Modern CPU chips come in multiple "cores".
								Each core acts as a an independent CPU.
								<div class="note">
									more cores does not mean faster CPU.
									A 4 cores CPU is not 4x faster than 1 core CPU.
									It does however affect program performance</p>
				</div>
				Based on my research it seems that 4 cores is a good number for most games.




				<h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
				<!--	<img class="thumb200" src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/ram200-01.png">-->
				<p>
					RAM is used for temporary storage.
					its faster to retrieve information from RAM than
					directly from the long term storage.


					Current Gen4 comes in 7 speeds (Mhz)
					• DDR4 1600
					• DDR4 1866
					• DDR4 2133
					• DDR4 2400
					• DDR4 2666
					• DDR4 2933
					• DDR4 3200



					<h3>Things to look for in a RAM</h3>

					<ul>
						<li> Capacity (in GB)</li>
						Capacity determine the max data the RAM can
						retain.

						<li> speed (in Mhz)</li>
						Speed determine the time it takes the RAM to retrieve
						Data from its table.
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p> Speed or size?
						More RAM. RAMs are fairly fast in storing and retrieving data.

						A 6 to 8GB DDR4 RAM with 2133-2400Mhz should good for most games.

						The next RAM gen DDR5 comes out in 2020 with speeds reaching 4800Mhz. but adoption by CPU
						makers wont be
						till 21-22.

					</p>

					<h2>Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
					<p> GPU like CPU but it process graphical instructions.
						These instructions are passed to the GPU for processing.

						What you should be looking for in a GPU:

					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>GPU clock speed (MHz)</li>
						<li>Memory bus (bits)</li>
						<li>vRAM size (MB)</li>
						<li>Memory clock rate (MHz)</li>
						<li>Memory bandwidth (GB/s)</li>
					</ul>


					<h2>Long Term Persistent Storage</h2>
					
					<p>
						This is a non-volatile storage medium.
						It is slower than a RAM

						SSD are faster than a HDD and more expensive too.
						it comes with different forms.


						If you want faster boot time and faster file transfers then SSD cards are desirable. They
						are typically
						less heavy and can be portable.
						HDD uses a moving disk to store data and that is slower than SSD.

					</p>
					<h4>Things to look for in storage device:</h4>



					<ul>
						<li>size (GB)</li>
						<li>speed (GHz)</li>
					</ul>





					<h2>Cooling sources</h2>
					<p>You need some cooling device for your system to avoid
						overheating, like a car radiator.
						<a href="">read more here</a> but for our purposes
						a refular fan will suffice
					</p>
					<p>Things you should be looking for</p>
					<ul>
						<li>pins in the fans</li>
						<p>some fans connect and controlled automatically
							by the motherboard and some can be controlled by the user.
							Depending on the section you plug it in
						</p>
					</ul>






					<h2>Power Supply</h2>
					<p>


						PSU comes with 2 ratings:
						The 80+
						And labels like
						original,bronze,silver,gold,platinum, or titanium

						The number is a rating that means a PSU
						is at least 80% effecient at different workloads.
						so at 100% workload.
						a PSU will supply at least 80%.

						The labels indicate extra effeciency at different workload
						ranging from 86% to 94%


						If you are going to pick a PSU with a label

						keep in mind that most PSU are
						most effecient at 50% workload.
						That means using 50% of what the PSU supply.


						After gathering the rest of the PC parts
						you need to figure out the amount of power you need.
						p50 = total-sys-power/.5
						p80 = total-sys-power/.8


						80+ means that it will work at 80% effecincy.
						so if your system need 350W and you have a
						350W PSU then it will supply 350*.8W.

						The ratings are for effecincy at different workloads
						for example
						80+ bronze has 82% effecincy at 20 to 100% workload.
						but 85% at 50%.
						titanium works at 90,92, and 94%
					</p>

					<p>
						PSUs come in different forms

						Non-Modular: it comes with all the cables preconnected

						Semi-Modular: will have only the basic cables attached to
						the unit, like the 24-pin motherboard connector, the 8-pin CPU cable,
						and the PCIe power connector that will go into your GPU

						Modular: Comes without any cables attached to it.

					</p>
					<ul>
						<li></li>
					</ul>





					<h2>Display Monitor</h2>
					<p>
						Why bother with a gaming setup if you
						cannot enjoy the result? :)
						The Display plays an important part in
						the pc build process deserve its own article
						<a href="">read more here</a> but for our
						purposes ill keep it brief.

					</p>
					<h4>Things to look for in a Display Monitor</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>How wide is it and what resuotion
							does it support
							<p>
								width is the physical dimension of the Display
								my research showed me that a standard gaming
								display is 27-30 inches. with support for
								1080p and more.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>How many Frames per second does it support

							<p>This can range from 64 to 128 FBS
								more frames = smoother picture.
								you do not need more than 32FPS
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>




					<h2>Keyboard and Mouse</h2>
					<p>
						If you want to game you want a keyboard that is big enough
						for fast tapping. For the Mouse you really can go with any.
						you can go for more aethetic Mouse but for the most part it will be the same
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The size of the key board</li>
					</ul>





					<h2>Chassis</h2>
					<p>Chassis are optional, Its just a way to neatly
						orgnize everything. you can hang them from the wall
						if you want to.

						If you decide to go with a chassis then have some
						points in mind
						Make sure there is a sufficent space for air to flow.

					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the size of the chassis</li>
						<p>you want a reasonable space between parts for air flow.
						</p>

					</ul>


					<p>Building a Computer can be a fun activity once you become familiar with its components. Its
						like
						building a car engine but with no gas or pollution.
						If you feel ready or want to experement with the different
						factors mentioned above
						I recommend <a href="https://www.pcpartpicker.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pc
