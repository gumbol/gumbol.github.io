			</div>

			<p> According to gamespot to be able to play
				<b>Assassin Creed Valhalla</b>
				at 1080p and 30 FPS you need a system that has parts with the following specs:
				<ul>
					<li><kbd>CPU</kbd><code> 6 - 4 cores. 3.2 - 3.6 GHz</code></li>
					<li><kbd>RAM</kbd><code> 8 GB</code></li>
					<li><kbd>GPU</kbd>
						<ul>
							<li><kbd>Pixel Rate</kbd><code> 37 - 72 GP/s</code></li>
							<li><kbd>Texture Rate</kbd><code> 149 - 120 GT/s</code></li>
							<li><kbd>Bandwidth</kbd><code>224 - 192 GB/s</code></li>
							<li><kbd>vRAM</kbd><code>8 - 6 GB</code></li>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li><kbd>Storage</kbd><code> 50 GB</code></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="note">
					I will be using the game <b>Assassin Creed Valhalla</b>
					system requirements as a performance reference because
					it is system demanding and can serve as a benchmark when we go through the parts</p>
				<p>With that in mind lets apply that to each part</p>

				<div id="mb"></div>
				<br>
				<h2>Motherboard</h2>

				<p>
					The motherboard combines the rest of the parts
					together and facilitate the communication
					between them. Choosing a good motherboard make sure
					all the other chips are communicating effectively.
				</p>

				<h3>Things to look for in a motherboard:</h3>
				<ul>

					<li>CPU chip-set support</li>
					<p>

						motherboards come in different models and every model
						is compatable with certain CPU chip-set.
						<p class="note">
							It is important to decide on the CPU before purchasing a motherboard
							and not vice versa. That way you are not limited to a certain chip-set
							to choose from.
						</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p> Even if the CPU is compatable with a motherboard
								You might need to update the motherboard BIOS
								to recognize the new chip-set model. and to do that
								you would need to have a CPU that is already compatable with the motherboard
								in order to be able to access the BIOS and update it.
							</p>
						</div>

						<li>What type and version of PCI-e does it have?
							<p> These are the slots where you plug in various cards.
								They come in different sizes:
								x1, x4, x8 and x16.
								GPU cards are typically x16 pins wide.

							</p>
							<p>
								A test made by <a
									href="www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2488-pci-e-x8-vs-x16-performance-impace-on-gpus">
									gamersnexus</a>
								showed that there is no real difference in
								performance between x8 and x16 card slots.
							</p>
							<p>
								This probably comes in handy if you find a cheaper
								motherboard that do not have x16 card slot.

							</p>


							<p class="note">
								Not all x8 card slots work. Make sure the
								motherboard has an <b>open ended x8 card slot</b>
								to accommodate wider cards.
								Although they will only be
								using a x8 card slot throughput.

							</p>



						</li>

						<li>How many PCI slots.
							<p>
								you want to aim at
								at a minimum
								you would need
								1 GPU slot and 1 RAM slot.
								and make sure the PCI is v2.0 and up
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>What size is it.
							<p> bigger forms have more features
								and expansion/card slots. Smaller ones are more compact</p>
							<p>Below are the 3 common sizes.</p>
						</li>
				</ul>

				<div id="cpu"></div>
				<br>
				<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>



				<p>
					CPU purpose is to process software instructions.
					It is important to have a fast processor
					because slow processor contribute to the game lag.

				</p>

				<h3>Things to look for in a CPU:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>speed (in GHz)

						<p>A 3.2 GHz CPU process
							3.2 billion instructions per second.
							based on our reference the game needs 6 cores 3.2 GHz or 4 cores 3.6 GHz to play
							&commat; 1080p 30FPS
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>Number of Cores.
						<p> A core acts as a an independent CPU.
							For example a 3.2GHz dual core CPU
							means it has two procesors that work at 3.2 GHz.
							Modern CPUs are at least dual core.

							<div class="note">
								more cores does not mean faster CPU.
								In our reference game a 6 core 3.2 GHz CPU
								does not mean <s>6*3.2</s>. Rather the CPU capacty increase.
								which enhances the program performance.</p>
						</div>
						<h4>Game reference: <kbd>CPU</kbd><code>6 -4 cores. 3.2 - 3.6 GHz</code></h4>
						Based on my research it seems that 4 cores is a good number for most games.
						And many of these CPUs can be over clocked. so the ryzen can be clocked to 3.6 GHz.
						Both CPU makers are great but Ryzen tend to have cheaper CPUs that almost the same perfomance as
						intel CPUs.

						<br>
						<br>
						<a href="#list">Back to top &gt;&gt;</a>
						<div id="ram"></div>
						<br>
						<h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>


						RAM is a temporary memory that holds instructions for the CPU for faster access.
						<h3>Things to look for in a RAM</h3>
						<ul>
							<li> Capacity (in GB)
								<p>More capacty means more data can be hold in the RAM.</p>

							</li>

							<li> speed (in MHz)
								<p> Speed determine the speed
									the RAM communicates the data with the other part.
									<!--	<p class="note">
				There is another speed measure that calculate the time
				between the RAM taking instruction and grabbing the information
				the RAM
			</p>-->
									RAMs come in many speeds from 1,600 MHz to 3,000+
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>More RAM speed or size?</b></p>
						<p>
							Short answer is more size.
							RAMs are fairly fast in storing and retrieving data.

						</p>

						<h4>Game reference: <kbd>RAM</kbd><code>8 GB</code></h4>
						<p>There is no mention of speed in the RAM specs
							but I would go with 6 to 8 GB DDR4 RAM with 2,133 or 2,400 MHz should be good
							for most games.</p>



						<p id="gpu"></p>
						<br>
						<h2>Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
						<p> GPU takes care of processing graphical instructions.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have decided to omitt the generic GPU speed and memory speed
							along with other factors in favor of
							derived metrics that, in my opinion give a clearer
							measure of performance.

						</p>
						<h3>Things to look for in a GPU</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><kbd>Pixel Rate</kbd> = (GPU speed) * (ROP/CU).
								<p>Measures the rate pixel render on screen</p>
							</li>
							<li><kbd>Texture Rate</kbd> = (GPU speed) * (TMU).
								<p>Measures the rate texture render on screen</p>
							</li>
							<li><kbd>Graphic layer ratio</kbd> = Texture Rate/Pixel Rate.
								<p>relationship between texture and pixel rendering</p>
								<p class="note">
									This is a measure i derived and thought might be useful.
									from what little i have read
									the texture is a layer that is rendered on top of pixels.
									smaller texture or greater pixel rate is better
								</p>
							</li>

							<li><kbd>Bandwidth</kbd> = vRAM speed * vRAM size * card bus width.</li>
							<li><kbd>vRAM size (GB)</kbd></li>
							<p>
								Affects the communication speed between the GPU and the
								other parts of the system.

							</p>




						</ul>

						<br>
						<br>
						<a href="#list">Back to top &gt;&gt;</a>

						<h4>Game reference:
							<kbd>GPU</kbd>
							<ul>
								<li><kbd>Pixel Rate</kbd><code> 37 - 72 GP/s</code></li>
								<li><kbd>Texture Rate</kbd><code> 149 - 120 GT/s</code></li>
								<li><kbd>Bandwidth</kbd><code> 223 - 192 GB/s</code></li>
								<li><kbd>vRAM</kbd><code> 8 - 6 GB</code></li>

							</ul>
						</h4>

						<p> While there are many factors that affects a GPU speed. The bandwidth
							gives pretty good measure of performance. It is calculated byFor a quick gauge the GPU
							bandwidthI
							decided to
							add these 4 factors because i think they </p>





						<div id="storage"></div>
						<br>
						<h2>Long Term Persistent Storage</h2>

						<h4>Things to look for in storage device:</h4>

						<ul>
							<li>size (GB)</li>
							<li>speed (GHz)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These unlike RAM will not lose the data when the PC is turned off.
							There is two types:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Hard Disk Drive (HDD) older model</li>

							<p>The HDD is an old model. It is slower than an SSD but cheaper.
							</p>

							<li>Solid State Drive (SSD) newer model</li>
							<p> SSD is is the new storage model.
								It has a faster boot time and faster file transfers
								than HDD but it is more expensive as well.</p>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<p>where does it make a difference?</p>
						<p class="note">
							SSD should be you go to storage model.
							The price comes into play only when
							you want to buy a huge amount of storage. i.e 500GB+
						</p>

						Below are different forms of SSD

			<div id="fan"></div>
			<br>

			<h2>Cooling sources</h2>
			<p>You need some cooling source for your system to avoid
				overheating. The most common source is a regular fan.
				There are other novel ways like dunking the system into an oil bath.
			</p>

			<h4>Things to look for in a fan</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Number of pins in the fans plug</li>
				<p>Depending on the number of pins
					some fans can be controlled
					by the user and some just work at full speed all the time.
				</p>
			</ul>

			<div id="psu"></div>
			<br>
			<h2>Power Supply</h2>

			PSUs come in 3 forms
			<img src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/psu-300w-01-linustechtips.webp" width="300">

			<p><b>Non-Modular:</b> Comes with all the cables soldered</p>

			<p><b>Semi-Modular:</b> will have the basic cables soldered to
				the unit, like the motherboard connector, the CPU cable,
				and the PCIe power connector</p>

			<p><b>Modular:</b>Comes without any cables soldered to the unit.</p>

			<p class="note">
				There is no performance difference between the 3 types. it is for convenience and
				aesthetic features.
				Modular PSUs are the most expensive. The non-modular is the cheapest, and semi-modular is between
			</p>

			<h4>Things to look for in a PSU</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Power supply
					<p>You would need enough power to
						run your system with enough buffer to
						avoid any system shut downs.
					</p>
					<p>
						you want to aim for <b><i>at
								least 20%</b></i> more power than your total system needs.
					</p>
					<p class="note">
						It is recommended that
						you have 80% more
						if you use a regular PSU
						and 50% more if you use a labeled PSU
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					Efficiency rating
					<p>
						PSU comes with an 80+ rating which means that
						the unit is at least 80% efficient at different workloads
						(20%,50% and 100%). so at 100% workload
						a PSU will supply at least 80%.
					</p>
					<p>
						some PSUs also come with different labels like
						bronze,silver,gold,platinum, or titanium.
					</p>
					<p>

						An 80+ bronze PSU at 20% and 100% workload
						would be 82% efficient.
						but 85% efficient at 50% workload.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="note">
				labeled PSUs are
				most efficient at 50% or peak workload.
				aim for 50% workload otherwise a regular 80+ PSU is fine.
			</p>


			<p>
				when you figure out your system total power needs
				plug the numbers in the formulas below to figure out
				the actual power needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				labeledPSU =<kbd> total-sys-power/.5</kbd><br>
				regularPSU =<kbd> total-sys-power/.8</kbd>

			</p>

			<a href="#list">Back to top &gt;&gt;</a>

			<div id="display"></div>
			<br>
			<h2>Display Monitor</h2>
			<p>
				A good monitor is one that is capable of displaying
				with the resolution you want and with the FPS you want.
				I have wrote an
				<a href="blog-intro-to-display-monitors.html">
					intro to display monitors</a> that talks in more detail.

			</p>


			<h4>Things to look for in a Display Monitor</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Native aspect ratio.
					<p>
						width is the physical dimension of the Display
						my research showed me that a standard gaming
						display is 27-30 (diagonal) inches.
						with support for at least 1080p resolution.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>FPS support

					<p>more frames = smoother picture.

						This can range from 32MHz to 128MHz
						movies run on 30FPS so you probably would not need more
						than 30-32 FPS
						you do not need more than 32FPS.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="#list">Back to top &gt;&gt;</a>

			<p id="kb"></p>
			<br>
			<h2>Keyboard and Mouse</h2>
			<p>
				If you want to game you want a keyboard that is wide enough
				and fast tapping and reaction time.

				<h4>Things to look for in a Keyboard</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Keyboard size
					</li>
					<li>
						Keys type
					</li>
					<li>
						Reaction time
					</li>
				</ul>
				you also need a keyboard that has big bulgy keys not
				flat keys. there are numerous typos out there, but the mechanical is
				the best.
				As for mouse i honestly couldn’t see much different in all the types
				i researched in terms of performance.
				For the Mouse you really can go with any.
				you can go for more aesthetic Mouse but for the most part it will be the same

			<br>
			<h2>Chassis</h2>
			<p>Chassis are optional, Its just a way to neatly
				orgnize everything. you can hang your parts
				on the wall if you want to.</p>

			<h4>Things to look for in a Chassis</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Size
					<p>You need to make sure there is enough space to
						accommodate all the parts easily.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Air flow
					<p>
						You want it to have a good air circulation.
						if heat cannot escape it will
						create what is called hot spots or pockets
						that can ruin your system.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
