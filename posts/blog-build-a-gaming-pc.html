				</div>
				<div>


					<p class="note">
						I will be using the game <b>Assasin Creed Valhalla</b>
						system requirments as a reference. I have not played the game
						. it was picked randomly</p>


					<p> According to gamespot to be able to play
						<b>Assasin Creed Valhalla</b>
						at 1080p, 30 FPS you would need:
						<ul>
							<li>CPU: 3.2 - 3.6GHz</li>
							<li>RAM: 8GB</li>
							<li>GPU: RX 570 - 8GB/GTX 1060 - 6GB</li>
							<li>Storage: 50GB</li>
						</ul>
						<p>With that in mind lets check each part</p>

						<div id="mb"></div>
						<br>

						<h2>Motherboard</h2>

						<p>
							The motherboard combines the rest of the parts
							and facilitate the communication
							between all the parts.
							For that reason it is important to choose a good motherboard
						</p>

						<h3>Things to look for in a motherboard:</h3>
						<ul>

							<li>What CPU chipset does it support?</li>
							<p>
								motherboard models are manufactored to serve certain CPU chipsets.
								It is important to decide on the CPU before purchasing a motherboard.

								<div class="note">
									<p> if you go with an old motherboard model
										you would need to update the BIOS and to do
										that you need a CPU that is compatable
										with the current BIOS in order to access it
									</p>
								</div>

								<li>What type and version of PCI-e does it have?
									<p> These are the slots where you plug in various cards.
										x1, x4, x8 and x16. GPUs typically come in x16.
										In some motherboards they can be plugged into x8
										but using only the x8 throughput.
										<p class="note">
											A test made by <a
												href="www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2488-pci-e-x8-vs-x16-performance-impace-on-gpus">
												gamersnexus</a>
											showed that there is no real difference in
											performance between x8 and x16</p>
										If it came to this pick the one that is cheaper but make sure that
										the x8 solt is open ended to accomedate the x16.
										start from version 2.0 @ x16 and up.

										you want to aim at
										at a minimum
										you would need
										1 GPU slot and 1 RAM slot.</p>
								</li>

								<li>What size is it.
									<p> bigger forms have more feauters
										and expansion slot. Smaller ones are more expensive</p>
									<p>Below are the 3 common sizes.</p>
								</li>
						</ul>

						<div id="cpu"></div>
						<br>
						<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
						<!--	<img class="thumb200" src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/cpu200-01.png">-->
						<p>Your first part to pick should be the CPU because other parts depend on the chipset you
							choose
						</p>
						<p>
							CPU purpose is to process software instructions.
							It is important to have a fast processor
							because slow processor contribute to the game lag.


						</p>

						<h3>Things to look for in a CPU:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>CPU clock speed (in GHz)
								A 3.2GHz process
								3.2 billion instructions per second.

							</li>


							<li>Number of Cores it has.
								<p> Modern CPU chips come in multiple "cores".
									Each core acts as a an independent CPU.
									<div class="note">
										more cores does not mean faster CPU.
										A 4 cores CPU is not 4x faster than 1 core CPU.
										It does however affect program performance</p>
				</div>
				Based on my research it seems that 4 cores is a good number for most games.

				<div id="ram"></div>
				<br>
				<h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>


				<h3>Things to look for in a RAM</h3>

				<ul>
					<li> Capacity (in GB)</li>


					<li> speed (in Mhz)</li>
					Speed determine the time it takes the RAM to retrieve
					Data from its table.
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p class="note"> More ram speed or more ram size?<br>
					More ram size.
					That is because rams are fairly fast in storing and retrieving data.
					A 6 to 8GB DDR4 RAM with 2133-2400Mhz (2.133Ghz-2.4Ghz) should be good
					for most current and perhaps couple of years ahead games.
				</p>
				<p id="gpu"></p>
				<br>
				<h2>Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
				<p> GPU like CPU but it process graphical instructions.
					These instructions are passed to the GPU for processing.

					What you should be looking for in a GPU:

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>GPU clock speed (MHz)</li>
					<li>Memory bus (bits)</li>
					<li>vRAM size (MB)</li>
					<li>Memory clock rate (MHz)</li>
					<li>Memory bandwidth (GB/s)</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#list">Back to top &gt;&gt;</a>
				<div id="storage"></div>
				<br>
				<h2>Long Term Persistent Storage</h2>
				<p>These unlike RAM will not lose the data when the PC is turned off.
					There is two types:
					HDD Hard Disk Drive
					SSD Solid State Drive
					The HDD is an old model. It is slower but cheaper than SSD specially when buying a significant
					amount of storage space.
					SSD is is the new storage model
					it has a faster boot time and faster file transfers than HDD but it is expensive as well.

					Every year technology gets cheaper so the comparison only holds when you
					want to buy a huge amount of storage (say in the terabyte range).

					Below are different forms of SSD
					<img src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/storage-type-300w-01.webp" width="300">
				</p>

				<h4>Things to look for in storage device:</h4>



				<ul>
					<li>size (GB)</li>
					<li>speed (GHz)</li>
				</ul>



				<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#list">Back to top &gt;&gt;</a>
				<div id="fan"></div>
				<br>
				<h2>Cooling sources</h2>
				<p>You need some cooling device for your system to avoid
					overheating, like a car radiator.
					<a href="">read more here</a> but for our purposes
					a refular fan will suffice
				</p>
				<p>Things you should be looking for</p>
				<ul>
					<li>pins in the fans</li>
					<p>some fans connect and controlled automatically
						by the motherboard and some can be controlled by the user.
						Depending on the section you plug it in
					</p>
				</ul>



				<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#list">Back to top &gt;&gt;</a>

				<div id="psu"></div>
				<br>
				<h2>Power Supply</h2>

				PSUs come in 3 forms
				<img src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/psu-300w-01-linustechtips.webp" width="300">

				<p><b>Non-Modular:</b> Comes with all the cables soldered</p>

				<p><b>Semi-Modular:</b> will have the basic cables soldered to
					the unit, like the motherboard connector, the CPU cable,
					and the PCIe power connector</p>

				<p><b>Modular:</b>Comes without any cables soldered to the unit.</p>


				Modular is the most expensive. The non-modular is the most practical, the other two are more for
				aesthtic
				features.


				<p>
					PSU comes with an 80+ rating which means that
					the unit is at least 80% effecient at different workloads
					(20%,50% and 100%). so at 100% workload
					a PSU will supply at least 80%.

					some PSU also come with different labels like

					bronze,silver,gold,platinum, or titanium.

					for example
					an 80+ bronze unit would have 82% effecincy at 20% and 100% workload.
					but 85% at 50% workload.
					titanium works out at at 90%,92%, and 94%.

					<p class="note">PSUs are
						most effecient at 50% workload.
						If you want to take advantage of the labeled (and more expensive)
						PSU, aim for 50% workload otherwise a regular 80+ PSU is fine.</p>




					In either case you want to aim for at
					least 20% more power than what your system needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					when you figure out the amout of power
					your system needs, plug the numbers in the formulars below.
				</p>
				<p>
					<kbd> labeledPSUpower = total-sys-power/.5
						regularPSUpower = total-sys-power/.8
					</kbd>
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#list">Back to top &gt;&gt;</a>

				<div id="display"></div>
				<br>
				<h2>Display Monitor</h2>
				<p>
					without a good monitor
					many of the pc power will be wasted.

					you would need a monitor that is capable of displaying
					the amount of pixels you want with the FPS you want.
					I have wrote a guide about
					<a href="blog-a-guide-to-buying-a-display-monitor.html">
						buying a display monitor</a> that goes into more detail.
					but for our purposes ill keep it brief.

				</p>
				<h4>Things to look for in a Display Monitor</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>How wide is it and what resolution
						does it support.
						<p>
							width is the physical dimension of the Display
							my research showed me that a standard gaming
							display is 27-30 (diagonal) inches.
							with support for at least 1080p resolution.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>How many Frames per second does it support

						<p>more frames = smoother picture.

							This can range from 32MHz to 128MHz
							movies run on 30FPS so you probably would not need more
							than 30-32 FPS
							you do not need more than 32FPS.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<br>

				<p id="kb"></p>
				<br>
				<h2>Keyboard and Mouse</h2>
				<p>
					If you want to game you want a keyboard that is big enough
					for fast tapping.
					you also need a keyboard that has big buldgy keys not
					flat keys. there are numrous typs out there, but the mechanical is
					the best.
					As for mouse i honestly couldny see much different in all the types
					i researched in terms of performance.
					For the Mouse you really can go with any.
					you can go for more aethetic Mouse but for the most part it will be the same
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The size of the key board</li>
				</ul>



				<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#list">Back to top &gt;&gt;</a>
				<p id="case"></p>
				<br>
				<h2>Chassis</h2>
				<p>Chassis are optional, Its just a way to neatly
					orgnize everything. you can hang your parts
					on the wall if you want to.

					however if you decide to go with a chassis
					then make sure there is enough room inside for air flow.
					even with fans installed, if heat cannot escape it will
					create what is called hot spots or pockets that can ruin your system.

				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the size of the chassis
						<p>you want a reasonable space between parts for air flow.
						</p>
					</li>

				</ul>


				<p>Building a Computer can be a fun activity once you become familiar with its components.
					I highly recommend you check <a href="https://www.pcpartpicker.com" target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer noopener">
						pcpartpicker</a> for all your parts. They have pre-built systems and also a more detailed option
					menu for each part
