				<p>
					After knowing the parts needed,
					the next step is to figure out the parts you need.
					I will be using <a href="https://">Assasin creed</a>
					system requirments as the basis.
				</p>



				<h2>Motherboard</h2>

				<img class="thumb200" src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/motherboard200-01.png">

				<p>
					The motherboard is the part
					that combine and facilitate the communication
					between all the other parts.
					For that reason it is important to choose a good motherboard

					<h3>Things to look for in a motherboard:</h3>
					<ul>

						<li>What CPU chipset does it support?
							<p>You need to make sure that the
								motherboard is compatible with
								the CPU you chose. There isnt many motherboard types
								(at least not for AMD CPUs).
								if you choose an old model however you need to have an old
								CPU to update the BIOS so it can recognize the
								next gen CPUs. That or</p>
						</li>


						<li>What type and version of PCI-e does it have
							<p> Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI-e)
								are the slots where you plug
								your expansion cards.
								expansion cards come with a set of pins that goes into these slots.
								x1, x4, x8 and x16. GPUs typically come in x16.
								In some motherboards they can be plugged into x8
								but using only the x8 throughput.
								A test made by <a
									href="www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2488-pci-e-x8-vs-x16-performance-impace-on-gpus">
									gamersnexus</a>
								showed that there is no real difference in
								performance between x8 and x16
								If it came to this pick the one that is cheaper.
								start from version 2.0 @ x16 and up.

								you want to aim at
								at a minimum
								you would need
								1 GPU slot and 1 RAM slot.</p>
						</li>

						<li>What size is it.
							<p> bigger forms have more expansion slots and therefore more options
								but smaller form factors are more compact and portable.</p>
							<p>Below are the 3 common sizes.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>


					<img src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/form-factor-300w-01.png" width="300">

					<p>Once you have picked the motherboard it is time to
						pick the main brain or the CPU</p>


					<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
					<img class="thumb200" src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/cpu200-01.png">

					<p>
						CPU purpose is to process software instructions.
						It is important to have a fast CPU so you do not experince lag

						All CPUs use the same basic arithmetic to process instructions.
					</p>

					<h3>Things to look for in a CPU:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>CPU clock speed (in GHz)
							<p>To give you a perspective
								A CPU with speed of 2 gigahertz
								performs 2 billion operation per second.
								you want to
							</p>
						</li>


						<li># of Cores (# of integrated chips) it has.
							<p> Modern CPU chips have multiple "cores". Each core is a semi-independent CPU.
								NOTE: more cores does not mean faster CPU. A 4 cores is not 4x faster than 1 core.
								i.e 4 cars does not get you there faster than 1 car.</p>

							More cores can enhance the gaming but more than 4 cores is really an overkill.
							If there is a game that require 4 or more cores is most likely poor coding.

							There is 2 major CPU makers: Intel and AMD.
							I have tried to understand their naming convention for their chips
							but it seems that there is no real pattern
						</li>


						</li>
					</ul>



					<h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
					<img class="thumb200" src="../media/blog-build-a-gaming-pc/ram200-01.png">
					<p>
						RAM is used for temporary storage.
						its faster to retrieve information from RAM than
						directly from the long term storage.


						Current Gen4 comes in 7 speeds (Mhz)
						• DDR4 1600
						• DDR4 1866
						• DDR4 2133
						• DDR4 2400
						• DDR4 2666
						• DDR4 2933
						• DDR4 3200

						More RAM is generally better. RAMs are fairly fast in storing and retrieving data.

						A 6 to 8GB DDR4 RAM with 2133-2400Mhz should good for most games.

						The next RAM gen DDR5 comes out in 2020 with speeds reaching 4800Mhz. but adoption by CPU
						makers wont be
						till 21-22.


						If you want to get technical there are latency calculation of ram CAS is the memory timings.
						The time it
						takes the memory to access columns of data.
						It has the following format: 15-16-16-35 the first column represent the CAS latency column
						access
						strobe. Its the number of clock cycles that pass between when an instruction is given and
						when the
						information is made available.

						To calculate this you do (CAS latency/RAM clock) x 2000 = latency in nanosecond (billionth
						of a second)

						if you have CAS 15 and clock speed of 2400mhz (15/2400)x2000 = 12.5 nanoseconds

						if you have CAS 17 and clock speed of 2666mhz (17/2666)x2000 = 12.75 nanoseconds

						If two rams with the same clock speed but different CAS latency

						example
						DDR4-3600 with CAS 15 has latency of 8.33 nanosecond
						DDR4-3600 with CAS 19 has latency of 10.56 nanoseconds


						This really does not matter much for most purposes the differences in very small that you
						wont even
						notice a performance change.



					</p>

					<h3>Things to look for in a RAM</h3>

					<ul>
						<li> Capacity (in GB)</li>
						Capacity determine the max data the RAM can
						retain.
						It is better to go for more capacity.
						I would suggest no more than 8GB of RAM will be enough.
						<li> speed (in Mhz)</li>
						Speed determine the time it takes the RAM to retrieve
						Data from its table.
					</ul>
					Concolusion:
					It is better to go for more RAM capacity than ram speed.

					<h2>Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
					<p>As games evolved there was a need for more
						specialized chips specially for repetitive instructions
						to process as a stand alone. This is where GPU comes into play.
						If CPU process code
						instructions GPU process graphical instructions.
						These instructions are passed to the GPU for processing.

						There is 2 major GPU makers: AMD and Nvidia. Both are great but AMD again is cheaper, and
						more
						mainstream. Nvidia is more for extreme setups

						What you should be looking for in a GPU:

						GPU clock speed (MHz)
						memory bus (bits)
						vRAM size (MB)
						memory clock rate (MHz)
						memory bandwidth (GB/s)


						The CPU and Motherboard also play a part since a
						fast GPU cannot compensate for a motherboard
						inability to deliver data quickly.
						similarly the card connection to the motherboard and the
						speed at which it can get instructions from the CPU</p>
					<ul>
						<li></li>
					</ul>


					<h2>Long Term Persistent Storage</h2>
					<p>

						This is a non-volatile storage medium.
						It is slower than a RAM

						SSD are faster than a HDD and more expensive too.
						it comes with different forms.




						If you want faster boot time and faster file transfers then SSD cards are desirable. They
						are typically
						less heavy and can be portable.
						HDD uses a moving disk to store data and that is slower than SSD.

					</p>
					<h4>Things to look for in storage device:</h4>



					<ul>
						<li>size (GB)</li>
						<li>speed (GHz)</li>
					</ul>





					<h2>Cooling sources</h2>
					<p>You need some cooling device for your system to avoid
						overheating, like a car radiator.
						<a href="">read more here</a> but for our purposes
						a refular fan will suffice
					</p>
					<p>Things you should be looking for</p>
					<ul>
						<li>pins in the fans</li>
						<p>some fans connect and controlled automatically
							by the motherboard and some can be controlled by the user.
							Depending on the section you plug it in
						</p>
					</ul>






					<h2>Power Supply</h2>
					<p></p>
					<ul>
						<li></li>
					</ul>





					<h2>Display Monitor</h2>
					<p>
						Why bother with a gaming setup if you
						cannot enjoy the result? :)
						The Display plays an important part in
						the pc build process deserve its own article
						<a href="">read more here</a> but for our
						purposes ill keep it brief.

					</p>
					<h4>Things to look for in a Display Monitor</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>How wide is it and what resuotion
							does it support
							<p>
								width is the physical dimension of the Display
								my research showed me that a standard gaming
								display is 27-30 inches. with support for
								1080p and more.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>How many Frames per second does it support

							<p>This can range from 64 to 128 FBS
								more frames = smoother picture.
								you do not need more than 32FPS
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>




					<h2>Keyboard and Mouse</h2>
					<p>
						If you want to game you want a keyboard that is big enough
						for fast tapping. For the Mouse you really can go with any.
						you can go for more aethetic Mouse but for the most part it will be the same
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The size of the key board</li>
					</ul>





					<h2>Chassis</h2>
					<p>Chassis are optional, Its just a way to neatly
						orgnize everything. you can hang them from the balcony
						if you want to.

						If you decide to go with a chassis then have some
						points in mind
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the size of the chassis</li>
						<p>you want a reasonable space between parts for air flow.
						</p>

					</ul>


					<p>Building a Computer can be a fun activity once you become familiar with its components. Its
						like
						building a car engine but with no gas or pollution.
						If you feel ready or want to experement with the different
						factors mentioned above
