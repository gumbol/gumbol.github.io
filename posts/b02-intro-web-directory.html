        <h1>Intro to static website directory</h1>

<div>
        

<p>If you navigate your favorite code hosting platform you will find many different directory structures. Some designed based on personal preference and others are with conventions by a particular framework. The approach mentioned here is by no means the only approach but it takes a lot from the recommended designs.</p>

         
   <h2>Directory structure</h2>
<p>The root folder of the website should include</p>
<p>- A folder to hold the html files.</p>
<p>- A folder to hold the css files.</p>
<p>- A folder to hold supplimental files. (images, documents, etc...)</p>
<p>- A folder to hold the javascript files.(if you use scripts)</p>
<p>- A folder to hold the text or raw data files before any processing.</p>
<p>- A README.txt or README.md to keep metadata about the directory structure</p>
<p>- An index.html.</p>
<p>- An about.html.</p>
<p>- A logo.</p>
		  
  <h2>Folder naming</h2>
        <p>- <b>blog</b>, <b>posts</b> or <b>articles</b> for the html folder.</p>
		<p>- <b>css</b> or <b>styles</b> for the css folder.</p>
		<p>- <b>media</b>, <b>images</b> or <b>assets</b> for supplimental resources folder.</p>
		<p>- <b>js</b> or <b>scripts</b> for the scripts folder (if you are use more than one type of script language then naming it scripts makes more snese)</p>   
        <p>- <b>texts</b> or <b>data</b> for the plain text folder</p>
			<p class="note">It is
            best to include README file in the root directory and sub-directories.
          </p>
       
        <h2>File nameing</h2>
        <p>- <b>Make the names meaningful</b> and not broad names like
            "myimage.jpg" or "mypost.html". You want to be able to have a good idea of the content of the file from the name.</p>

        <p>- <b>Make it short </b> as longer names will not get processed properly on some software and technology. (e.g. bluetooth will not process files with long names). A good range would be around 50 characters.
          </p>
        <p>- <b>Avoid spaces!!</b> as they have special use in software. They signal the end of a character and can affect the rendering of pages. Instead use <b>hyphens -, underscore _ or camelCase</b> to seperate words</p>
          
		<p>- <b>Don't use special characters</b> like  &acd; ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * (
            ) ` ; &lt; &gt; ? , &lsqb; &rsqb; { } ‘ “ because these
            characters have explicit programmatic purpose (with the exception of hyphen and underscore character)</p>

        <p>- <b>If using dates use</b> the ISO format YYYY-MM-DD or YY-MM-DD.</p>
	
		<p>- <b>Use leading zeros</b> when naming sequentially. File systems use
          leading zeros (i.e file-01, file-001, etc) to order content.
        </p>
        
		<p>The most improtant thing to keep in mind when creating a naming scheme is to <b>be consistent.</b> A naming system will not work if its not followed properly.</p>
        
       
  

<p class="note">		  
A note about hyphens and underscores is that hyphens has SEO support, is more visible on hyperlinks than underscores (as hyperlinks tend to have <a>under_scores</a>) and some search engines do not recognize underscores.</p>

<p class="note">CamelCase names might cause processing issues when ported in different operating systems. (i.e linux OS treat my-file and MY-File as two different files but windows OS treat them as the same file)
</p>
       
        
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <p> <b>A simple naming style:</b> sunflower-200w-01.png</p>
        <p> <b>A more invoved naming style:</b> thisIsA-blog_post-19-02-15.html</p>
      

        <p> I took a lot of inspiration from github's huge collection of repos. For more examples you can check
          <a href="https://www.github.com/gumbol/gumbol.github.io">
            my website directory.</a> or any of the other repositories</p>
			
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Staying consistent when creating a directory system is important to keep it working.
