<p>If you navigate your favorite code hosting platform you will find many different directory structures. Some designed based on personal preference and others are with conventions by a particular framework. The approach mentioned here is by no means the only approach but it takes a lot from the recommended designs.</p>

         
   <h2>Directory structure</h2>
<p>The root of the website should include</p>
<p>A folder that hold the html files.</p>
<p>A folder that holds the css files.</p>
<p>A folder to hold the javascript files. (optional)</p>
<p>A folder to hold the raw data files before any processing.</p>
<p>A <b>README</b> file that provide information about the directory structure its in.</p>
<p>An <b>index.html</b> file that represent the website entry or main page</p>
<p>An <b>about.html</b> file that provide information about the website itself and its owner(s)</p>
<p>A <b>logo </b> file</p>
		  
  <h2>Folder naming</h2>
          <p><b>js</b> or <b>scripts</b> for folders that includes the scripting files</p>
          <p><b>css</b> or <b>styles</b> for folders that includes the stylesheets files</p>
          <p><b>blog</b> or <b>posts</b> or <b>articles</b> for folders that includes the html</p>
          <p><b>media</b> or <b>images</b> or <b>assets</b> for folders that includes supplimental resources.</p>
          <p><b>texts</b> or <b>data</b> for folders that includes the raw files</p>
        
 
        
			
			<p class="note">It is
            best to include one README file in the root directory and sub-directories.
          </p>
       
        <h2>File nameing</h2>

        <p>The name scheme you choose does not matter as long as it complies
          with the following guidlines:
        </p>

        
          <p><b>Make the names meaningful</b> and not broad names like
            "myimage.jpg" or "mypost.html". You want to be able to have a good idea of the content of the file from the name.</p>

          <p><b>Make it short </b> as longer names will not get processed properly on some software and technology. (e.g. bluetooth will not process files with long names). A good range would be around 50 characters.
          </p>
          <p><b>Avoid spaces!!</b> as they have special use in software. They signal the end of a character and can affect the rendering of pages.</p>
          
		  <p><b>Don't use special characters</b> like  &acd; ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * (
            ) ` ; &lt; &gt; ? , &lsqb; &rsqb; { } ‘ “ because these
            characters have explicit programmatic purpose (with the exception of hyphen and underscore character)</p>

          <p><b>If using dates use</b> the ISO format YYYY-MM-DD or YY-MM-DD.</p>
		  
          <p>The most improtant thing to keep in mind when creating a naming scheme is to <b>be consistent.</b> A naming system will not work if its not followed properly.</p>
        
       
          <p>Use <b>Hyphens -, underscore _ or camelCase</b> in the names as they greatly improve readability. 

<p class="note">		  
A note about hyphens and underscores is that hyphens has SEO support, is more visible on hyperlinks than underscores (as hyperlinks tend to have <a>under_scores</a>) and some search engines do not recognize underscores.</p>

<p class="note">CamelCase names might cause processing issues when ported in different operating systems. (i.e linux OS treat my-file and MY-File as two different files but windows OS treat them as the same file)
</p>
        <p>Use <b>leading zeros</b> when naming sequentially. File systems use
          leading zeros (i.e file-01, file-001, etc) to order content.
        </p>
        
<h4>Examples</h4>
  <p> <b>A simple naming style:</b> sunflower-200w-01.png</p>
        <p> <b>A more invoved naming style:</b> thisIsA-blog_post-19-02-15.html</p>
      

        <p> I took a lot of inspiration from github's huge collection of repos. For more examples you can check
          <a href="https://www.github.com/gumbol/gumbol.github.io">
            my website directory.</a> or any of the other repositories</p>
			
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Staying consistent when creating a directory system is important to keep it working.
