			<p> A favicon is a 32x32 or even 16x16 pixel image that appears on the browser tabs, but also in other places like bookmarks, search engine results and other areas!. But what do they do and should you have one?</p>

			<figure>

					<i><b>Figure 1</b>Favicons on Firefox browser tabs.</i>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
<br>
			<p>favicons were intended as an icon to the favored/bookmarked links. Nowadays these little icons can be found in many different settings. you might have figured that from its name (fav-icon)</p>

			<h2>Favicon in bookmarks</h2>
			<p>If you navigate to your favorite/bookmark page you can see a list of page links with titles but <b>NOT</b> the actual host name that these pages originated from.</p>

	<figure>
				<img src="../media/images/b05-favicon-02-347w.PNG" alt="favicon icons">
				<figcaption>
					<i><b>Figure 2</b></i> Favicons look on Microsoft edge favorite bar.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
<br>
<p>What a favicon does in this case is show an icon (a brand) that can be associated with the source of the pages. If you look at figure 2. the pages without a favicon does not seem to stand out. These pages will easly get lost/fogotten in a sea of hyperlinks.
</p>
<p>Favicons can keep your brand exposoure consistent throughout the website pages and even outside of it. So it might be worthwhile to spend sometime on favicon design if you are building a brand for example.
			</p>
		
			

			
			
				<h2>Favicon in search engines</h2>
			<p>
				Favicons can be useful when displayed in search engines results. It can help drive traffic to your website and increase page hits. A clever favicon design can help encourage users to click on your page links.
			</p>


			<h2>Favicon design styles</h2>
		<figure>
			<img src="../media/images/b05-favicon-01-400w-zoom200.PNG" alt="favicon icons">
	<figcaption>
			<i><b>Figure 1 from Favicon on bookmarks section </b></i>
		</figcaption>
			</figure>
<br>
			<p>By the nature of its size favicons are not good at showing sophesticated graphical designs. If you look again at figure 1 you notice that the brand design is focused and simple. Some use alphanumerals (e.g. W3) others use a mascot (e.g. GIMP). Colors are also conserved to less than 3 colors. More than 3 colors can make the icon hard to discern. Favicons dont have to be 2d either. They can be 3d, or even animated.</p>


<p>This is just a small taste on these awseome web styles. I enjoyed writing about this and I hope you did reading it too.</p>
