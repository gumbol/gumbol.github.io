			<p>favicons are small images that are (or were) used as icons for page links added in a browser favorite list. They come in 64x64, 48x48, 32x32 or even 16x16 pixel size but with advent of smart phones you can see sizes up to 144x144. In addition to favorite list they also appear on the browser tabs, search engine results, and can even be added as an app icon on smart phones screens!. Favicon is an amalgam of two words, favorite and icon</p>

					<p>Favicons can be used to make yout website act as a native app on smart phones. Firefox for android provides this functionality for you. This greatly increase your brand visiability. You can also increase engagement of such favicon by making the webpage it points to designed as a <a href=
			"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/single-page_application">single-page application</a>.
</p>

				<div>
			<h2>Favicon in bookmarks</h2>
		
			<p>If you navigate to your favorite/bookmark page you can see a list of page links with titles but <b>NOT</b> the actual host name that these pages originated from.</p>

			</figure>

<p>What a favicon does in this case is show an icon (a brand) that can be associated with the source of the pages. If you look at figure 3. the pages without a favicon does not seem to stand out. These pages will easly get lost/fogotten in a sea of hyperlinks.
</p>
<p>Favicons can keep your brand exposoure consistent throughout the website pages and even outside of it. So it might be worthwhile to spend sometime on favicon design if you are building a brand for example.

				<h2>Favicon in search engines</h2>

				Favicons can be useful when displayed in search engines results. It can help drive traffic to your website and increase page hits. A clever favicon design can help encourage users to click on your page links.

			<h2>Favicon design options</h2>

			<p>Because of its small size favicons are not a good for showing sophesticated graphical designs. If you look again at figure 1 you'll notice that some designs use alphanumerals (e.g. W3) others use a mascot (e.g. GIMP) but they all show a focused and simple desgin. Colors are also conserved in favicons to less than 3 colors. More than 3 colors can make the brand/icon hard to discern. Favicons don't have to be 2d either. They can be 3d, or even animated.</p>
</div>


	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Favicons are a great way to keep users engaged with a website content or to a brand visiability. It also easy to make and distrbute and can be a deciding factor for pages being clicked on the search engine hits or even in other places in the web. Favicons do not require complex graphic design to be effective.</p>
