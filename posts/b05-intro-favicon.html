				<h1>Intro to favicons</h1>
	
			</header>
<h2 id="section1">What are favicons?</h2>

			<p> A favicon is a 32x32 or even 16x16 pixel image that appears on the browser tabs, but also in other places like bookmarks, search engine results and many more!</p>

			<figure>

					<b>Figure 1</b> Favicons on Firefox browser tabs.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
<br>
			<p>Favicons were intended as an icon to the favored/bookmarked links. Nowadays these little icons can be found in many different settings. you might have figured that from its name (fav-icon)</p>
			
				<h2>Favicon in smartphones</h2>
			
			<p>Favicons can be great on smartphones. Their size and shape makes them blend well with the app system of smarphones and tablets. These hyperlinks can be static web page or a full <a href=
			"en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/single-page_application">single-page application!</a>.
</p>			
			<figure>
		<img src = "../media/images/b05-phone-apps01-573w.jpg" alt = "phone apps" width="573" style="height:300px">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Figure 2</b> Favicon links from firefox browser on android.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			
		
			
			<h2>Favicon in bookmarks</h2>
			<p>If you navigate to your favorite/bookmark page you can see a list of page links with titles but <b>NOT</b> the actual host name that these pages originated from.</p>

	<figure>
				<img src="../media/images/b05-favicon02-347w.PNG" alt="favicon icons" style="width:100%; height:300px">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Figure 3</b> Favicons on Microsoft edge favorite window.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
<br>
<p>What a favicon does in this case is show an icon (a brand) that can be associated with the source of the pages. If you look at figure 2. the pages without a favicon does not seem to stand out. These pages will easly get lost/fogotten in a sea of hyperlinks.
</p>
<p>Favicons can keep your brand exposoure consistent throughout the website pages and even outside of it. So it might be worthwhile to spend sometime on favicon design if you are building a brand for example.
			</p>
		
			

			
			
				<h2>Favicon in search engines</h2>
			<p>
				Favicons can be useful when displayed in search engines results. It can help drive traffic to your website and increase page hits. A clever favicon design can help encourage users to click on your page links.
			</p>


			<h2>Favicon design options</h2>
		<figure>
			<img src="../media/images/b05-favicon01-400w-zoom200.PNG" alt="favicon icons">
	<figcaption>
			<b>Figure 1 from <a href= "#section1">favicon on bookmarks section</a> </b>
		</figcaption>
			</figure>
<br>
			<p>Because of its small size favicons are not a good for showing sophesticated graphical designs. If you look again at figure 1 you'll notice that some designs use alphanumerals (e.g. W3) others use a mascot (e.g. GIMP) but they all show a focused and simple desgin. Colors are also conserved in favicons to less than 3 colors. More than 3 colors can make the brand/icon hard to discern. Favicons don't have to be 2d either. They can be 3d, or even animated.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Favicons are a great way to keep users engaged with a website content or a brand. Its also easy to make and distrbute and can be a deciding factor for users clicking on a page in the search engine hits or even in other places in the web. Favicons do not require intensive graphic design to be effective. I enjoyed writing about this and I hope you did reading it too.</p>
