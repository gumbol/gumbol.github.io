    <h1> Guidelines For Web Development
    </h1>
  
    <p>This guidlines a collection of conventions to website
    development suggested by many universities and promenant technology vendors.
    (i'll add sources as we read). 
    But is there a standard? as far as i saw no. 
    It turns out that
    web development is more flexible than that. and there are general guidelines
  that are adopted by most web developers which i will be going through here</p>
    
    <h3>Who is this for?<h3>
   <p> This is for users of all learning stages. It is a collection of
    basic guidelines makes the development much easier and enhance
    productivity whether you are a beginner or an expert.
    </p>

  <p>Web development process can be broken down into 3 steps</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Directory structure</li>
   <li> Web page structure</li>
    <li>Web page presentation</li>
    </ol>
    
        <h2>Directory Structure</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Folder name</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>File name</p>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <p>When i started this website the first thing i had to work with
      was the website directory. I quickly realized i needed to properly
      structure the website directory before it gets messy.
      A good directory structure is like code organization and code
      comments. It is not only important to understand the code but to
      know the content without extra clicks.</p>
    
    <h3>Folder name:</h3>
    <p>The root folders of a website typically has the following
    structure(note that all names are in lowercase<br>
    except for the README file).</p>
    
    <p>Note also that I included several names for each folder. I found
    that htese are the most used (they are separated by a backslash):</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li> <b>js/scripts</b>: Include the scripting files that take
        care of the web page behavior</li>
      <li> <b>css/styles:</b> Include your CSS files that take care of
        the web page presentation/look</li>
      <li> <b>blog/posts/articles:</b> Include the html files that take
        care of the web page structure</li>
      <li> <b>media/images/assets: </b>Include the media resources of
        the website.<br>
      </li>
      <li> <b>text/data:</b> Includes the raw content of the web pages
        before any html structuring</li>
      <li> <b>index.html</b> The main page<br>
      </li>
      <li> <b>about.html</b> The about page</li>
      <li> <b>logo.png</b> The website logo<br>
      </li>
      <li> <b>README.txt</b> A text file that provide description of
        the directory (It is the equivalent of comments in codes). It is
        best to include one README file inside all root folders. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>File name:</h3>
    
  <p>After naming and structuring the root folders i had to create my
    file naming scheme. I made my decisions based on the following guidelines:
   </p> 

    <ul>
      <li><b>Make it meaningful: </b>Do not use arbitrary names like
        "myimage.jpg". This makes it hard to know what the image is
        later on and it also affects screen readers when they scan the
        name of the image.</li>
      <li><b>Make it short: </b>Longer names are harder to parse in
        some software and it also limit understanding. I try to make
        mine less than 25 characters.<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Don't use spaces: </b>If you use space it will be replaced
        by its hex value 20% when requested. Space signifies the end of
        a character and can halt the page from rendering properly if at
        all.</li>
      <li><b>Don't use special characters: </b>~ ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * (
        ) ` ; &lt; &gt; ? , [ ] { } ‘ “ with the exception are the
        hyphen and underscore character. why? because other characters
        have explicit programmatic purposes.</li>
      <li><b>If using dates use</b> YYYY-MM-DD or YY-MM-DD format.</li>
      <li><b>Be consistent: </b>with whatever style you decide to
        pursue.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Which to use underscore or hyphen?</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Use hyphen instead of underscore.</b> why? SEO support,
        visible when hyperlink is rendered in screen, and some SE do not
        recognize underscore.</li>

      <li><b>Use all lowercase characters: </b>This is to avoid
        operating systems compatibility and usability issues (i.e linux
        treat my-file and My-file as two different files but windows
        does not)<b>
        </b></li>

      <li><b>Use leading zeros:</b> when naming sequential files use a
        leading zero (i.e file-01, file-001, etc).
        
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p> <b>Naming example 1:</b> this-is-a-blog-post.html</p>
  <p>    <b>Naming example 2:</b> sunflower-200w-01.png</p>
    
    For a complete examples look up <a
      href="https://www.github.com/gumbol/gumbol.github.io">the
      directory of my website.</a>

  
      


        <h2>Web Page development</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>html and web page structure</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CSS and web page presentation</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
  <p>After getting the directory structure figured out and you have
    created a naming plan that fits your needs (and that you should be
    consistent with). It is time to check how to develop a page.</p>
    
    <h4>html and web page structure</h4>
    html is used to structure the raw content into (meaningful)
    sections. I When structuring a web page your users you should code
    the element it in a way that makes the code itself easy to read
    later that it is meaningfull normal users and users that use screen
    readers to navigate.<br>
    <br>
    Best practice<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Use as little markup as possible: this makes the page more
        readable and more meaningful (avoid using too much div element)
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Make the elements meaningful: This means choosing an element
        that best describe the content it contain. (i.e using &lt;p&gt;
        for paragraphs and &lt;li&gt; for lists)</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    finding the and the right elements will benefit you and your users
    greatly. Just like we did with structuring the directory.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>It will make the code more readable to you and your team.</li>
      <li>It will be more meaningful and that will help users who use
        screen readers to navigate through the site.</li>
      <li>It will improve the site SEO</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have a ready made template that i use for all the pages.<br>
      The most used html tags are &lt;p&gt; (paragraphs)<br>
    </p>
    <h4>CSS and web page presentation<br>
    </h4>
    After getting the html page ready we get to the presentation
    section. several points to focus on when styling a page. like html
    structure it boils down to usability<br>
    <br>
    <br>
   <p> Fonts: There are several good fonts that you can choose from but the
    best font for the web is Arial. 
    followed by the "times roman".
    </p>
    Use a font that is available to all users: what this means is that
    you should prioritize font types that are pre installed in the users
    computers. you can chain as many fonts as you want starting with the
    most important. <br>
    <br>
    Using the following property<br>
    <br>
    font-type: arial, "times roman", sans-serif;<br>
    <br>
    Make fonts readable.<br>
    Use fonts that are good for reading on the web. avoid art styled
    fonts for normal document flow even for titles.<br>
    <br>
    Choose a font color that contrast with the background.<br>
    <br>
    This is self explanatory. you should use colors that does not
    obfuscate the words<br>
