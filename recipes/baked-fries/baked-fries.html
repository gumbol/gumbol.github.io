This is a simple recipe for baking fries till crispy!. Now crispy is
a subjective matter but no matter! this recipe will get it crisp<br>
<br>
<b>Ingredients</b><br>
2 medium potatoes sliced with skin on<br>
2 tbsp olive oil<br>
1/4 tsp black pepper<br>
1/4 tsp salt<br>
<b><br>
</b><b>Preparation</b><br>
In a bowl mix all the ingredients together until the fries are
coated (very important!)<br>
Now i have read many recipes on how much time and what temp is
needed to make them crispy. But they are all too technical. I heat
the oven to 350F (175C) and let it cook for about 40min. The fries
in the picture were bleached so i did around 30min. They came out
not wet nor super dry they were firm. This is how i like my crispy,
feel free to let them bake for another 5-10min!<br>
