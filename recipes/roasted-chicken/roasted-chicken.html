Roasted chicken <br>
<br>
This is a favorite of mine. It is simple yet packed with flavor!.
you only need a chicken (butterflied) some mixed herbs, what i used
in the following dish had around 16 blends including garlic and
onions! (if you have any mix herbs I recommended sticking to ones
that have less than 16 blends.) but use whatever you feel like
using.&nbsp; Some dry red pepper and salt. It is simple yet
flavorful!. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Ingredients: </b><br>
<ul>
<li>whole chicken butterflied (flattened out)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1.5 tsp mixed herbs</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1/2 tsp dry red pepper (use gloves when handling these or the
heat will stick to your fingers for a long while)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
</ol>
<p> <br>
<b>Preparation</b><br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Go ahead and butterfly the chicken</li>
<br>
<li>mix the rest of the ingredients together then rub the whole chicken</li>
<br>

hour

<li>Turn the oven to 350F(175C). Put the chicken in an oven pan and
cover with foil</li>
<br>
<li>Cook for around 45 minutes (you do not want it to cook too
quickly)</li>
<br>
<li>Remove the foil and turn on the grill (the ceiling of the
oven) to crisp the skin. around 5-10 minutes</li>

<p>This is after it was cooked.</p>
